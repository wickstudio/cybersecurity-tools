# Wireless Attacks Tools Guide

## Introduction to Wireless Attacks

Wireless networks are often seen as convenient but can also be a significant security risk if not properly secured. Wireless attacks target the vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks, potentially allowing attackers to intercept traffic, gain unauthorized access, or disrupt services. Understanding these attacks is crucial for securing wireless networks and protecting sensitive information transmitted over the air.

### Why Wireless Security Matters

Wireless networks extend the reach of the internet, making them accessible from outside the physical boundaries of a building. This increased accessibility makes them a prime target for attackers. Securing wireless networks is essential to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other forms of cyberattacks. Regular testing of wireless networks using appropriate tools can help identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

## Popular Wireless Attack Tools in Kali Linux

Here’s an overview of some of the most commonly used wireless attack tools available in Kali Linux:

### 1. **Aircrack-ng**

**Overview**:
Aircrack-ng is a suite of tools designed for assessing Wi-Fi network security. It includes tools for monitoring, attacking, testing, and cracking Wi-Fi networks. Aircrack-ng is widely used for capturing and analyzing packets, as well as for cracking WEP and WPA/WPA2 keys.

**Key Features**:
- **Airmon-ng**: Puts your wireless interface into monitor mode.
- **Airodump-ng**: Captures raw 802.11 frames.
- **Aireplay-ng**: Injects packets into a network to generate traffic or perform deauthentication attacks.
- **Aircrack-ng**: Cracks WEP and WPA/WPA2-PSK keys.

**Getting Started with Aircrack-ng**:

1. **Setting Up Monitor Mode**:

   ```bash
   sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
   ```

   - This command enables monitor mode on your wireless interface (`wlan0`).

2. **Capturing Packets**:

   ```bash
   sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
   ```

   - Use `airodump-ng` to capture packets from nearby wireless networks. It will display available networks and associated clients.

3. **Deauthentication Attack**:

   ```bash
   sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a <BSSID> wlan0mon
   ```

   - This command sends deauthentication packets to disconnect clients from a network, forcing them to reconnect and allowing you to capture the WPA/WPA2 handshake.

4. **Cracking WPA/WPA2 Keys**:

   ```bash
   sudo aircrack-ng -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -b <BSSID> capture-01.cap
   ```

   - After capturing the handshake, use `aircrack-ng` with a wordlist to crack the WPA/WPA2 key.

### 2. **Reaver**

**Overview**:
Reaver is a tool specifically designed to exploit WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) vulnerabilities. It performs brute-force attacks to recover the WPS PIN, which can then be used to retrieve the WPA/WPA2 passphrase.

**Key Features**:
- Brute-force attacks on WPS-enabled networks.
- Recovers WPA/WPA2 passphrases once the WPS PIN is cracked.
- Effective against routers with vulnerable WPS implementations.

**Getting Started with Reaver**:

1. **Scanning for WPS-Enabled Networks**:

   ```bash
   sudo wash -i wlan0mon
   ```

   - Use `wash` to scan for networks with WPS enabled.

2. **Launching a Reaver Attack**:

   ```bash
   sudo reaver -i wlan0mon -b <BSSID> -vv
   ```

   - Reaver will start brute-forcing the WPS PIN of the target network. If successful, it will reveal the WPA/WPA2 passphrase.

3. **Optimizing Reaver**:
   - Adjust the delay and retry settings for faster or more reliable attacks:

   ```bash
   sudo reaver -i wlan0mon -b <BSSID> -d 0 -vv
   ```

   - The `-d 0` option sets the delay between attempts to zero, speeding up the attack.

### 3. **Wireshark**

**Overview**:
Wireshark is a powerful network protocol analyzer that can capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network. While not specifically a wireless attack tool, Wireshark is invaluable for analyzing captured wireless traffic, including decrypted packets after a successful attack.

**Key Features**:
- Real-time capture and analysis of network traffic.
- Deep inspection of hundreds of protocols, including 802.11 wireless protocols.
- Offline analysis of previously captured traffic.
- Ability to decrypt captured traffic (if the encryption key is known).

**Getting Started with Wireshark**:

1. **Capturing Wireless Traffic**:

   - Start Wireshark and select your wireless interface in monitor mode (`wlan0mon`) to start capturing packets.
   - Use display filters to focus on specific types of traffic, such as:

   ```bash
   wlan.fc.type_subtype == 0x08
   ```

   - This filter shows only beacon frames.

2. **Analyzing Captured Traffic**:
   - Once you’ve captured the traffic, you can analyze it to identify handshakes, probe requests, and other wireless communication.
   - If you have the WPA key, you can decrypt the captured traffic by providing the key in Wireshark’s decryption settings.

3. **Following Streams**:
   - Right-click on a packet and select “Follow TCP Stream” to view the entire conversation between devices.

4. **Exporting Data**:
   - Export specific packets or streams for further analysis or reporting.

### 4. **Kismet**

**Overview**:
Kismet is a wireless network detector, sniffer, and intrusion detection system. It passively collects packets and can detect hidden networks, identify rogue access points, and track devices over time.

**Key Features**:
- Detects wireless networks and clients, including hidden SSIDs.
- Logs traffic for later analysis.
- Detects rogue access points and other potential security threats.
- Supports multiple wireless protocols, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and Zigbee.

**Getting Started with Kismet**:

1. **Launching Kismet**:

   ```bash
   sudo kismet
   ```

   - Kismet will automatically detect your wireless interfaces and start capturing traffic.

2. **Monitoring Networks**:
   - Kismet provides a web-based interface where you can monitor detected networks, devices, and access points in real-time.

3. **Identifying Hidden Networks**:
   - Kismet can identify hidden SSIDs by capturing and analyzing probe requests and responses.

4. **Logging and Analysis**:
   - Kismet logs all captured traffic, which can be reviewed later using tools like Wireshark or directly within Kismet.

## Best Practices for Ethical Wireless Testing

Wireless testing can be powerful, but it must be conducted ethically and responsibly:

1. **Always Have Authorization**:
   - Ensure you have explicit permission from the network owner before conducting any wireless attacks. Unauthorized attacks are illegal and unethical.

2. **Minimize Disruption**:
   - Wireless attacks, especially deauthentication attacks, can disrupt legitimate users’ access to the network. Perform tests during off-hours or in controlled environments to minimize impact.

3. **Document Your Actions**:
   - Keep detailed logs of your actions during wireless testing. This documentation is crucial for reporting and can help you replicate or explain your findings later.

4. **Use Secure Configurations**:
   - Ensure your own wireless networks are configured securely, using strong encryption (WPA3 if available) and disabling WPS if not needed.

5. **Educate and Report**:
   - After conducting wireless tests, provide detailed reports to the network owner and educate them on how to improve their wireless security.

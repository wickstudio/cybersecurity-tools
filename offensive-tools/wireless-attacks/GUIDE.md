# Wireless Attacks Tools Guide

## Introduction to Wireless Attacks

Wireless attacks target the security vulnerabilities of wireless networks, primarily Wi-Fi. These attacks can be used to gain unauthorized access, eavesdrop on communications, or disrupt network services. Wireless networks, being inherently less secure than wired networks, are a common target for attackers. Understanding and testing the security of wireless networks is crucial for protecting sensitive data and ensuring the integrity of the network.

### Why Wireless Security Matters

Wireless networks are convenient, but they also introduce significant security risks. Attackers can exploit weak encryption, poorly configured access points, or unsecured devices to gain access to a network. Once inside, they can intercept communications, launch further attacks, or access sensitive data. Regularly testing and securing wireless networks helps prevent these types of attacks and protects both the network and its users.

## Common Wireless Attack Techniques

Before diving into the tools, here’s an overview of some common wireless attack techniques:

1. **WEP/WPA/WPA2 Cracking**:
   - Cracking weak or improperly configured wireless encryption to gain access to the network.

2. **Evil Twin Attack**:
   - Setting up a rogue access point that mimics a legitimate one to trick users into connecting, allowing the attacker to intercept communications.

3. **Deauthentication Attack**:
   - Sending deauthentication frames to force clients off a network, often used in conjunction with cracking tools to capture handshakes.

4. **Rogue Access Point**:
   - Setting up an unauthorized access point within a legitimate network to intercept traffic or provide a backdoor into the network.

5. **Wi-Fi Phishing**:
   - Setting up a fake Wi-Fi login page to capture credentials when users try to connect to the network.

## Popular Wireless Attack Tools

Here’s an overview of some essential tools used in wireless attacks:

### 1. **Aircrack-ng**

**Overview**:
Aircrack-ng is a suite of tools for assessing Wi-Fi network security. It includes tools for monitoring, attacking, testing, and cracking Wi-Fi networks. Aircrack-ng is one of the most popular tools for wireless penetration testing and is widely used for WEP and WPA/WPA2 cracking.

**Key Features**:
- Capture packets and perform monitoring with `airodump-ng`.
- Inject packets into a network with `aireplay-ng`.
- Crack WEP and WPA/WPA2 keys with `aircrack-ng`.
- Decrypt captured packets and analyze them.

**Getting Started with Aircrack-ng**:

1. **Installing Aircrack-ng**:
   - On Kali Linux, Aircrack-ng is pre-installed. On other distributions:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install aircrack-ng
   ```

2. **Capturing Packets**:
   - Start by putting your wireless interface into monitor mode:

   ```bash
   sudo airmon-ng start wlan0
   ```

   - Use `airodump-ng` to capture packets:

   ```bash
   sudo airodump-ng wlan0mon
   ```

   - This will display nearby networks. To focus on a specific network, use:

   ```bash
   sudo airodump-ng -c <channel> --bssid <BSSID> -w capture wlan0mon
   ```

3. **Deauthentication Attack**:
   - Use `aireplay-ng` to deauthenticate clients from the network, forcing them to reconnect and capture the handshake:

   ```bash
   sudo aireplay-ng --deauth 10 -a <BSSID> wlan0mon
   ```

4. **Cracking WPA/WPA2**:
   - Once you have captured a handshake, use `aircrack-ng` to crack the password:

   ```bash
   sudo aircrack-ng -w /path/to/wordlist.txt -b <BSSID> capture-01.cap
   ```

### 2. **Reaver**

**Overview**:
Reaver is a tool designed to brute-force the WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) PIN on wireless routers. Once the WPS PIN is cracked, it can be used to recover the WPA/WPA2 passphrase, allowing full access to the network. Reaver is effective against routers that have WPS enabled and are vulnerable to brute-force attacks.

**Key Features**:
- Brute-forces the WPS PIN on vulnerable routers.
- Can recover the WPA/WPA2 passphrase once the WPS PIN is obtained.
- Supports various attack modes and can be combined with other tools for enhanced effectiveness.

**Getting Started with Reaver**:

1. **Installing Reaver**:
   - On Kali Linux, Reaver is pre-installed. On other distributions:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install reaver
   ```

2. **Scanning for WPS-Enabled Networks**:
   - Use `wash` to scan for WPS-enabled networks:

   ```bash
   sudo wash -i wlan0mon
   ```

3. **Running Reaver**:
   - To brute-force the WPS PIN, run:

   ```bash
   sudo reaver -i wlan0mon -b <BSSID> -vv
   ```

   - This command will start the brute-force attack. If successful, Reaver will display the WPS PIN and the WPA/WPA2 passphrase.

4. **Optimizing the Attack**:
   - Reaver has several options to optimize the attack, such as changing the delay between attempts or using a specific WPS PIN.

### 3. **Wireshark**

**Overview**:
Wireshark is a widely used network protocol analyzer that can capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network. While not specifically a wireless attack tool, Wireshark is invaluable for analyzing the data captured during wireless attacks, such as inspecting captured handshakes or monitoring traffic in real-time.

**Key Features**:
- Capture and analyze network traffic in real-time.
- Deep inspection of hundreds of protocols, with more being added all the time.
- Offline analysis of previously captured data.
- Decrypting captured packets (if the encryption key is known).

**Getting Started with Wireshark**:

1. **Installing Wireshark**:
   - On most Linux distributions, you can install Wireshark with:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install wireshark
   ```

2. **Capturing Wireless Traffic**:
   - Start Wireshark and select your wireless interface (in monitor mode) to start capturing packets.
   - Use filters to focus on specific traffic, such as:

   ```bash
   wlan.addr == <BSSID>
   ```

3. **Analyzing Captured Traffic**:
   - Once you’ve captured traffic, you can analyze it to identify handshakes, probe requests, and more.
   - If you have the WPA key, you can decrypt the captured traffic by providing the key in Wireshark’s settings.

### 4. **Kismet**

   - Wifite will then automatically perform deauthentication attacks, capture handshakes, and attempt to crack passwords.

4. **Reviewing Results**:
   - Wifite saves the results of its attacks (including captured handshakes) in a specified directory for further analysis.

## Best Practices for Ethical Wireless Testing

Wireless attacks can be highly effective, but they must be conducted ethically

:

1. **Obtain Proper Authorization**:
   - Always ensure you have explicit permission from the network owner before conducting any wireless attacks. Unauthorized testing is illegal and unethical.

2. **Minimize Disruption**:
   - Wireless attacks, especially deauthentication attacks, can disrupt legitimate users’ access to the network. Perform tests during off-hours or in controlled environments to minimize impact.

3. **Document Your Actions**:
   - Keep detailed logs of your actions during wireless testing. This documentation is crucial for reporting and can help you replicate or explain your findings later.

4. **Use Secure Configurations**:
   - Ensure your own wireless networks are configured securely, using strong encryption (WPA3 if available) and disabling WPS if not needed.

5. **Educate and Report**:
   - After conducting wireless tests, provide detailed reports to the network owner and educate them on how to improve their wireless security.

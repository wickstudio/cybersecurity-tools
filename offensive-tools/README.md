# Offensive Security Tools

## Overview

Welcome to the Offensive Security Tools section! This directory contains a collection of guides focused on offensive security, including tools and techniques used in penetration testing, vulnerability assessments, exploitation, social engineering, and wireless attacks. These guides are designed to help you understand and apply various methods for assessing and improving the security of systems, networks, and applications.

## Directory Contents

### 1. **[Penetration Testing](./penetration-testing/GUIDE.md)**
   - Penetration testing is the process of simulating cyber attacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in a system. This guide covers the key phases of penetration testing, including reconnaissance, scanning, exploitation, and reporting. It introduces essential tools like Nmap, Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, and others to help you conduct effective penetration tests.

### 2. **[Vulnerability Assessment](./vulnerability-assessment/GUIDE.md)**
   - Vulnerability assessment involves identifying and prioritizing vulnerabilities in a system or network. This guide provides an overview of tools like Nessus, OpenVAS, and QualysGuard that can help you scan for vulnerabilities, assess risk, and prioritize remediation efforts. Learn how to perform regular scans and interpret the results to strengthen your security posture.

### 3. **[Exploitation](./exploitation/GUIDE.md)**
   - Exploitation is the phase where identified vulnerabilities are actively exploited to gain unauthorized access or execute code on a target system. This guide introduces powerful tools like Metasploit, ExploitDB, and buffer overflow techniques. Learn how to use these tools ethically to demonstrate the impact of vulnerabilities and help organizations understand their security risks.

### 4. **[Social Engineering](./social-engineering/GUIDE.md)**
   - Social engineering attacks exploit human psychology to gain unauthorized access to information or systems. This guide covers tools like the Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET), Gophish, and Beef that are used to simulate phishing, pretexting, and other social engineering attacks. Learn how to conduct these attacks ethically and use the insights to improve security awareness and training.

### 5. **[Wireless Attacks](./wireless-attacks/GUIDE.md)**
   - Wireless networks are a common target for attackers due to their inherent security challenges. This guide introduces tools like Aircrack-ng, Reaver, Wireshark, and Kismet for assessing and exploiting vulnerabilities in Wi-Fi networks. Learn how to perform wireless attacks, such as WEP/WPA cracking, deauthentication attacks, and rogue access point creation, in an ethical manner.

# Offensive Security Tools

## Overview

Offensive security involves using ethical hacking techniques to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in systems, networks, and applications before malicious attackers can exploit them. This guide provides an overview of the primary offensive security categories covered in this project, including exploitation, penetration testing, social engineering, vulnerability assessment, and wireless attacks.

## Tools and Guides

### 1. Exploitation Tools
- **Purpose**: Exploitation tools are used to take advantage of vulnerabilities in systems to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code.
- **Guide**: [Exploitation Tools Guide](../offensive-tools/exploitation/GUIDE.md)

### 2. Penetration Testing
- **Purpose**: Penetration testing simulates cyberattacks on systems, networks, or applications to assess their security posture.
- **Guide**: [Penetration Testing Guide](../offensive-tools/penetration-testing/GUIDE.md)

### 3. Social Engineering
- **Purpose**: Social engineering involves manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information or performing actions that compromise security.
- **Guide**: [Social Engineering Guide](../offensive-tools/social-engineering/GUIDE.md)

### 4. Vulnerability Assessment
- **Purpose**: Vulnerability assessment tools identify, classify, and prioritize vulnerabilities in systems, helping organizations address security gaps.
- **Guide**: [Vulnerability Assessment Guide](../offensive-tools/vulnerability-assessment/GUIDE.md)

### 5. Wireless Attacks
- **Purpose**: Wireless attack tools target vulnerabilities in wireless networks, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and other wireless communication protocols.
- **Guide**: [Wireless Attacks Guide](../offensive-tools/wireless-attacks/GUIDE.md)
